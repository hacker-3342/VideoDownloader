This program coded in Python 3.12.5 allows the user to insert the URL of a video from youtube.com and create an mp4 file and an m4a file (video and audio).

*The mp4 file will only have both video and audio if the "Use ffmpeg" switch is toggled and FFmpeg is installed.

## Libraries used:

yt_dlp==2024.8.6
customtkinter==5.2.2
ctkmessagebox==2.7

## Installation instructions:

The user must have FFmpeg (https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) installed if they want to use the "Combine into a single file" feature. FFmpeg isn't needed for the rest of the program. 

### Windows

Run the setup guided installer.

### MacOS

Choose your .zip file depending on your Mac's chip architecture. x86_64 for Intel chips, ARM for M1, M2... 
Run the .app file and you are done.

### Linux

Run the executable file and you are done.
Some text and rendering may look strange, this is due to some CustomTkinter rendering issues on Linux.
