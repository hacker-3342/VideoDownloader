This program coded in Python 3.12.5 allows the user to insert the URL of a video from youtube.com and create an mp4 file and an m4a file (video and audio).

*The mp4 file will only have both video and audio if the "Use ffmpeg" switch is toggled and FFmpeg is installed.

## Libraries used:

yt_dlp==2024.8.6
customtkinter==5.2.2

## Installation instructions:

The user must have FFmpeg (https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) installed if they want to use the "Combine into a single file" feature. FFmpeg isn't needed for the rest of the program. In case you are new to adding programs to your computer's PATH, the following WikiHow article explains how to do it. 
WikiHow article explains in a very clear and simple way how to install and add FFmpeg (https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows) to the PATH.

If you have added FFmpeg to your system PATH, but Windows still does not recognize FFmpeg from the terminal, try doing the following:

### Windows (only operating system with a distribution)

The executable file is located inside the “VideoDownloader.dist” folder. The name of the executable file is VideoDownloader.exe. To run the program just open the executable file and you are done.
